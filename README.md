Starting your day on the right foot can set the tone for the rest of it!
So why not begin by indulging in some cozy comforts like listening to your favorite tunes,
checking the weather forecast, and sipping on some refreshing hydration to jump-start your morning routine?

It's a fantastic beginner project that's helping me hone my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
The best part is that it pulls weather data from an open source API to tell users what their
day is going to be like! But that's not all, it also has a feature where users can choose from
a selection of relaxing songs to play. And the cherry on top? The website is designed to be
visually pleasing and absolutely delightful to look at! I can't wait for you to check it out!
